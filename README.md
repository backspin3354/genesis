A 90's-inspired first-person game engine.

## Idea
I want to create my own simple game engine, similar to those used for FPS games in the 90's.

My goal is to be fully 2.5d, like in "Duke Nukem 3D". If it goes well, I might expand to full
3D, like in "Quake".

I was inspired by Ken Silverman's "Build Engine" and by the "FreeDOOM" project. I decided to
try and make my own engine and game. This is both for educational purposes and personal use. I
do want to make games, but I want to do it my way. I like doing low-level development and I'm
not really comfortable with modern game engines (I do love Godot, but I prefer to hack things
together myself). So, I'm making this. I've attempted this same project a few times, but I've
finally resolved to complete it, in some fashion.
